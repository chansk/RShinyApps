# Define UI (HTML webpage) that draws a histogram
  # fluidPage auto adjusts to browser dimensions
  
  # Define server logic required to draw a histogram
  # contains functions for server (computer) to build the app
  # I think server gets run every time
  # Guess: plotOutput("distPlot") in ui.R calls output$distPlot, which uses
    # the number of bins selected as "input"
    
- follow these instructions: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/basics.html 
  - this is following example 3
- for this example, faithful seems to already be built-in dataseet

  # Reactive expression: returns dataset corresponding to user choice
  # Rendering expresssions: create summary and view values
    # only executed when dependencies change (input$dataset or input$obs)
