We're going to make an intro page with two panels
- images will be held within www folder
- ui.R is the HTML webpage
  - fluidPage fxn auto adjusts to browser dimensions
- server.R contains functions for server (computer) to build the app
  - I think server gets run every time
  - Guess: plotOutput("distPlot") in ui.R calls output$distPlot, which uses
    - the number of bins selected as "input"
